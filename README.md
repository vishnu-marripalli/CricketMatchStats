# CricketScorePro

## Introduction
CricketScorePro is a web application designed to manage and display real-time cricket scores. The primary objective of this project is to provide an interactive and user-friendly platform for manually updating and viewing cricket scores on a ball-by-ball and over-by-over basis. This project is built using React for the front-end and Redux for state management, ensuring a seamless user experience and efficient handling of the application's state.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Score Update**: Manual input for runs scored on each ball, update wickets, overs, and balls in real-time, display the total score and current over progress.
- **Bowler's Economy Rate**: Calculate and display the economy rate of the bowler based on runs conceded and overs bowled.
- **Batsman Details**: Show details of the strike and non-strike batsmen including their individual scores.
- **Current Over Display**: Visual representation of the current over, showing the outcome of each ball (e.g., runs scored, wickets).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is accessible and usable on various devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components.
- **Redux**: A state management library for JavaScript applications, used to manage the application state in a predictable way.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The programming language used to add interactivity and functionality to the application.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several components and modules, each responsible for different aspects of the application.
